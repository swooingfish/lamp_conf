# Displays Apache accesses per vhost based on diffs between log files.
# Grabs the Apache log files and computes the difference in size for
# each one.  This will give you an idea of which virtual hosts are
# seeing the most activity.  Useful if a server is overloaded and
# fullstatus is slow or inaccessible.  Do a sanity check on the access
# log names, this may need to be edited to accomodate logfiles
# withouth access_log in the name.
# Usage: apache_log_growers SECONDS
